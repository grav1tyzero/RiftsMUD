json_encode - serializes an LPC value as JSON

SYNOPSIS
    string json_encode(mixed value)

DESCRIPTION
    Returns a string attempting to represent the passed value in JSON
    (JavaScript Object Notation; see http://json.org/).

    The data types which map well from LPC to JSON are single-value mappings
    with string keys (which are represented as objects), arrays, strings,
    ints, and floats.

    Many LPC values, including objects, closures, quoted arrays, and symbols,
    have no valid JSON representation.  json_encode() uses "null" for these.
    Non-string mapping keys also have no valid JSON representation; these
    are skipped.

    json_encode() represents zero-width mappings as JSON arrays and
    multivalue mappings as if the value sets were arrays of values.  These
    representations are inexact and do not result in restoration of the
    original value via json_decode().

    If json_encode() encounters a self-referential data structure, it will
    use "null" for inner references to the structure (instead of recursing
    infinitely).

EXAMPLES
    json_encode(([ "name" : "Bob" ])) => "{\"name\":\"Bob\"}"

    json_encode(({ 1, 2, 0.5 })) => "[1,2,0.5]"

    mixed * selfref = ({ 1, 2, 3, 0 });
    selfref[3] = selfref;
    json_encode(selfref) => "[1,2,3,null]"
