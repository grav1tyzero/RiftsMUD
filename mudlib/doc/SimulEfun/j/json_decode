json_decode - deserializes a JSON string to an LPC value

SYNOPSIS
    mixed json_decode(string json)

DESCRIPTION
    Converts the passed JSON (JavaScript Object Notation; see http://json.org/)
    string to an LPC value and returns it.

    The JSON values that map inexactly to LPC are true (which maps to 1), false
    (which maps to 0) and null (which also maps to 0).  As most JSON platforms
    use higher-precision floating-point numbers than most LPC platforms, loss
    of floating-point precision should also be anticipated.  Also, as JSON
    strings are UTF-8 encoded, an LPC driver which isn't prepared to handle
    UTF-8 may encounter issues with them.

EXAMPLES
    json_decode("{\"name\":\"Bob\"}") => ([ "name" : "Bob" ])

    json_decode("[1,2,0.5]") => ({ 1, 2, 0.5 })
