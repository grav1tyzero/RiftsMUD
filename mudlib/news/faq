1)  Theme
	 
	 IMPORTANT:  This is an advanced mud.  It is extremely complex
     in several ways that will become obvious as you play.  We do not 
     advise that you play this mud if you have never mudded before, as 
     we have coded it with the seasoned mudder in mind.  If this is your
     first mud, good luck, you can expect to die EXTREMELY often.  This
     mud is largely combat-oriented, and experienced or not, you can 
     expect to die more here than on most other muds.  Because of this, the
     penalties of death are mild.

         This mud is based on Rifts from Palladium games. No we dont' have 
    a valid license to use the content so don't tell anyone we're here.

2)  Races
    For info on races, rcc, and OCC buy the Rifts Books. We won't be telling
    you about things you would learn from getting the books. That wouldn't
    be fair to the makers of the game.

3)  Stats

    Again for info on stats. check out the Palladium Rifts core book.

4) RCC/OCC
    RCC or OCC is what you are in terms of abilities/skills. Check out the
    game books for more info about the specifics. We're going to give you 
    very basic info.

5)  Experience
    You gain experience by achieving things in the game. Defeating foes, 
    advancing the storyline, completing objectives. Rifts has famously 
    never been directly about combat. The plan is that you'll get 
    diminishing returns for fighting the same things over and over.

6) Advancement 
    Check out the Rifts books for info on this.
     
7)  Combat 
    The rules of Rifts combat are challenging to implement in a MUD. 
    You can choose to parry, block, dodge, roll based on the attack 
    coming at you. Defensive abilities will likely be setup to be
    based on some sort of threshold checking.

    For more depth on the rules of Rifts, buy the books.

     See help on the following:
     	kill	wield	wear	body	status	score

8)  Law
         The rules of this MUD are "Be respectful. Try to roleplay."
    No abuse will be tolerated. If you wouldn't say it to your 
    grandmother, don't say it here.


9)  Economy
	 In rifts there are credits, then there are black market items. For 
   the most part credits are seemingly interchangeable anywhere you go, 
   but where they aren't you can trade blackmarket goods for things.

10)  Item Storage
	 Everything on your person will save when you quit. 

11)  Communication
    My goal is to put in a language system where your understanding is 
    based off the skill.

     See help on the following:
 	tell	say	reply	yell	shout	lines
	communication	languages	speak

12) The Mud Clock

     	On DarkeMUD, time passes roughly four times as fast as real
     world time.  In order to see what time, day, month, etc. it is on
     the mud clock, type 'time'.  Several spells, skills, etc. as well
     as night/day cycles, shop opening/closing times, and other events
     are based on the mud clock.  DO NOT CONFUSE the 'time' command with
     the 'date' command.  The 'date' command gives you the REAL time,
     and can be set to your own time zone if desired (see 'help setenv').
     
     See help on the following:
     	time	calendar	setenv
